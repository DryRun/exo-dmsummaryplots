0) Setup

- Install MadGraph:
https://launchpad.net/mg5amcnlo
- In the MG5_aMC_vx_y_z/model directory, get the DMSimp models:
http://feynrules.irmp.ucl.ac.be/wiki/DMsimp
- Make sure the couplings correspond to the LHC DM WG recommendations:
V&A: gq=1, gDM=0.25
S&P: gq=gDM=1
- Install MadDM in the MG5_aMC_vx_y_z directory:
Make sure it is version >2.0.6, as this has the fix for the DM DM > Z' Z' process.

1) First crosscheck

- Run the MadDM script example.py
- Then, change the example.py script such that it points to
--> Your DMSimp model
--> The correct DM candidate
Choose some benchmark points (coupling/masses) to crosscheck the results are correct.
Previous CMS results, to crosscheck, are documented here: http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08525 

2) Then, scan the parameters

For this, you can use: param_scan_default.py

This is by default provided by MadDM.
The version in this directory has some modifications to make the scanning easier.
It needs to be run in the Projects/<projectname> directory.

The main thing is that you should change the name of the scan parameters.
In your case these are:
--> the mass of the DM particle 
--> the mass of the Mediator

3) Finally, to make a nicer plot

plotTGraph2D.py

This is for plotting. You can use that after the full scan is done.
(Scan used to take a few hours, but this might be longer with the new models.)
